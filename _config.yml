      description: The Diive blockchain bootcamp is an intensive 3 week course which covers the basics of blockchain technology and Solidity coding.  The mornings consisted of intense, fast paced learning about blockchain technology, while the focus shifted to practical applications of the theory in the afternoons. The general theme was around enablement of financial inclusion. During the course of the bootcamp the students were tasked to create their own digital identity, hash it and store it on the Bitcoin blockchain. The students were able to validate each other’s identities and used it as a KYC mechanism to open simulated bank accounts and apply for dummy visa’s. “Regulators” checked for compliance, based on the reputation of the validators. Students then created a token on Ethereum to be used as an incentive tool in the decentralised identity system. The afternoons were reserved for teaching the students softer skills. Several industry experts visited the students to speak about business, entrepreneurship and leadership. The students also had opportunities to engage with South African based blockchain startups such as Xago, The Sun Exchange, Nona, Omniscient, Wala, Linum Labs and Coil to name a few. Fun activities were also included in between the training such as shark cage diving, paragliding, wine tasting and cooking lessons in Khayelitsha!  <br/><br/> The following outcomes were reached during the course:<br/> -	Defining the role of trust in modern financial systems and how blockchains change that <br/> -	Knowing the components and architecture of both open public and private permissioned blockchains and how they operate <br/> -	Understanding how blockchains achieve trust through consensus mechanisms and game theory of public and permissioned blockchains <br/> -	Understanding and applying the mathematical principals of public key cryptography, data integrity and immutability (proof of work) <br/> -	Knowing how blockchains can be applied to a corporate setting, especially with regards to document provenance and KYC compliance processes <br/> -	Comprehending the disruptive nature of cryptocurrencies and digital assets <br/> -	Be able to record digital assets on a blockchain, and using this knowledge to build self-sovereign identity systems <br/> -	Understanding the basic architecture of smart contracts and their real world applications <br/> -	Be able to compile, test and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain <br/> -	Understand the basic syntaxes of Solidity, design smart contracts, deploy it to Ethereum, interact with it and analyze the code using a block explorer <br/> -	Understand the use cases, strengths and limitations of Ethereum <br/> -	Work in a dynamic diverse team to apply our blockchain knowledge to solve a real world problem and present it to a panel of experts  <br/><br/> On the last day of the bootcamp, we participated in hackathon. We had to define a problem with financial inclusivity and conceptualise a blockchain solution. We had to deeply define the problem, design the high level technical architecture of the solution, a user interface and develop some sample code of the backend. We worked in teams of 6 and had 5 hours to design and present the final product to a panel of experts. Our team developed a decentralised marketplace for second-hand goods with built-in escrow services and protection for both the buyer and seller. A reputation token allowed for resolving disputes.  <br/><br/>

   <strong>Articles</strong>: I enjoy writing articles about open blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin. Since I also work in the energy industry, Bitcoin's electricity usage is a subject <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@careldj/bitcoin-mining-as-a-revenue-increasing-mechanism-for-eskom-407cd134b648"> that fascinates me. </a> I've written about <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@careldj/a-review-of-the-power-requirements-for-a-bitcoin-majority-attack-c314c67eecb3"> the power requirements for a Bitcoin Majority attack </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@careldj/bitcoin-mining-as-a-revenue-increasing-mechanism-for-eskom-407cd134b648"> using Bitcoin as a short term revenue fix </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@careldj/bank-of-international-settlements-report-on-cryptocurrencies-critical-analysis-f3e811a6ddf6"> criticised the Bank of International Settlements view on Cryptocurrencies. </a> <br/><br/>

#   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
